# Title

## Project Overview
---
This data analysis project aims to investigate the factors that influence whether a customer purchases a bike or not. The dataset includes information about customer characterists and purchase decisions.

We will resolve this case following this methodology:

`ASK, PREPARE, PROCESS, ANALYSE, SHARE AND ACT`


## **ASK**

This phase involves defining the issue to be solved, identifying stakeholders and what their expectations from the project are.

Two questions will guide the future marketing program:

1. What Demographic Factors Influence Bike Purchases?
   
    - Explore the relationship between age, gender, and income levels of customers and their likelihood to purchase a bike.
  
    - Analyze if certain demographics are more inclined to make bike purchases.
  
2. How Does Customer Commute Distance Impact Bike Purchase Decisions?

   - Is there a correlation between the length of the customer commute and the likelihood of making a bike purchase?
     
   - Do customers with shorter commutes show a higher tendency to purchase bikes compared to those with longer commutes?


### Business Task
Identify and understand the key factors influencing bike purchases to optimize marketing strategies.

### Key Stakeholders
- **Marketting Analytics Team**: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy.
  
- **Executive Team**: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.
