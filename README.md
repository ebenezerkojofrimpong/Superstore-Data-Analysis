# The Path to Profitability: Comprehensive Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview
---
This data analysis project aims to investigate the factors that influence whether a customer purchases a bike or not. The dataset includes information about customer characterists and purchase decisions.

We will resolve this case following this methodology:

`ASK, PREPARE, PROCESS, ANALYSE, SHARE AND ACT`


## **ASK**

This phase involves defining the issue to be solved, identifying stakeholders and what their expectations from the project are.

Two questions will guide the future marketing program:

1. What are the key drivers of sales performance?
   
    - Which products or categories contribute the most to revenue?
  
    - Are the specific time periods or seasons with higher sales?
  
2. How can customer segmentation be leveraged to enhanve the overall shoppping experience and increase customer loyalty?

   - Can distinct customer segments be identified based on purchasing behavior?
     
   - What are the preferences and buying patterns of different customer segments.

3. How can we optimize our shipping strategy to align with customer preferences and enhance overall satisfaction?

   - What ship mode is most prefered by customers, and how does it align with their expectations?
  
   - Are there opportunities to tailor shipping options based on customer preferences to enhance overall satisfaction?
  
4. How can can discount levels be optimized to maximize overall sales volume?

   - How do different discount levels influence overall sales volume?
  
   - Can you identify specific products or categories where discounts have a more significant impact on sales?
