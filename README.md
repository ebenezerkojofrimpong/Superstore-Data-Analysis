# Unveiling Trends: A Comprehensive Four-Year Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview
---
This data analysis project aims to investigate the factors that influence whether a customer purchases a bike or not. The dataset includes information about customer characterists and purchase decisions.

We will resolve this case following this methodology:

`ASK, PREPARE, PROCESS, ANALYSE, SHARE AND ACT`


## **ASK**

This phase involves defining the issue to be solved, identifying stakeholders and what their expectations from the project are.

Two questions will guide the future marketing program:

1. What are the key drivers of sales performance?
   
    - Which products or categories contribute the most to revenue?
  
    - Are the specific time periods or seasons with higher sales?
  
2. How can customer segmentation be leveraged to enhanve the overall shoppping experience and increase customer loyalty?

   - Can distinct customer segments be identified based on purchasing behavior?
     
   - What are the preferences and buying patterns of different customer segments.

3. How can we optimize our shipping strategy to align with customer preferences and enhance overall satisfaction?

   - What ship mode is most prefered by customers, and how does it align with their expectations?
  
   - Are there opportunities to tailor shipping options based on customer preferences to enhance overall satisfaction?
  
4. How can can discount levels be optimized to maximize overall sales volume?

   - How do different discount levels influence overall sales volume?
  
   - Can you identify specific products or categories where discounts have a more significant impact on sales?

2. A compelling insight emerges from the data, revealing that New York City stands out significantly with the highest total sales volume of $256K, indicating unique factors contributing to its robust sales performance. Moreover, the Canon imageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier demonstrates exceptional resonance with customers, generating over 2x more sales revenue than the next highest-selling product and constituting 25% of total sales among the top 10 products, showcasing distinctive qualities that captivate consumers.
  
   On the other end, the Eureka Disposable Bags for Sanitaire Vibra Groomer Upright Vac, with a sale of $2.00, represents the least sold product, providing a point of interest for further analysis and potential optimization.

3. A significant insight derived from the data is that the Technology category contributes 37% to total sales revenue, surpassing both Furniture and Office Supplies, which account for 32% and 31% each respectively. Additionally, despite the Corporate and Home Office segments contributing 31% and 19% to total sales revenue respectively, the Consumer Segment stands out, accounting for 50%.

   This highlights the substantial influence of the Consumer Segment in driving a disproportionate share of the overall business, suggesting potential areas for targeted strategies and further exploration to capitalize on the strength of the Consumer Segment."
